# odin-recipes
This project is building a basic recipe website.
It will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
The purpose of this project is to work on HTML skills, with future revisions in CSS.

The recipes are mango lassi, gobi manchurian, and palak paneer. Everything is linked to the index.html, and back. The project is currently only in HTML.
